## Path Resolution 

  The GSD workflow files contain bash commands that reference `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. 
  **In this workspace, the module lives at `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` relative to the workspace root — `$HOME` does not apply.
  ** When executing or interpreting any bash snippet from a workflow file, mentally substitute `$HOME/.claude/` → `.claude/` (workspace-relative).
