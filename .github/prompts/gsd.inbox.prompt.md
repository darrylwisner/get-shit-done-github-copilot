## Path Resolution 

  The GSD workflow files contain bash commands that reference `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. 
  **In this workspace, the module lives at `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` relative to the workspace root — `$HOME` does not apply.
  ** When executing or interpreting any bash snippet from a workflow file, mentally substitute `$HOME/.claude/` → `.claude/` (workspace-relative).

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
One-command triage of the project's GitHub inbox. Fetches all open issues and PRs,
reviews each against the corresponding template requirements (feature, enhancement,
bug, chore, fix PR, enhancement PR, feature PR), reports completeness and compliance,
and optionally applies labels or closes non-compliant submissions.

**Flow:** Detect repo → Fetch open issues + PRs → Classify each by type → Review against template → Report findings → Optionally act (label, comment, close)
</objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/inbox.md
</execution_context>

<context>
**Flags:**
- `--issues` — Review only issues (skip PRs)
- `--prs` — Review only PRs (skip issues)
- `--label` — Auto-apply recommended labels after review
- `--close-incomplete` — Close issues/PRs that fail template compliance (with comment explaining why)
- `--repo owner/repo` — Override auto-detected repository (defaults to current git remote)
</context>

<process>
Execute the inbox workflow from @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/inbox.md end-to-end.
Parse flags from arguments and pass to workflow.
