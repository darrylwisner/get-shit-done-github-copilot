## Path Resolution 

  The GSD workflow files contain bash commands that reference `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. 
  **In this workspace, the module lives at `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` relative to the workspace root — `$HOME` does not apply.
  ** When executing or interpreting any bash snippet from a workflow file, mentally substitute `$HOME/.claude/` → `.claude/` (workspace-relative).

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Generate a developer behavioral profile from session analysis (or questionnaire) and produce artifacts (USER-PROFILE.md, `gsd-dev-preferences` skill config, CLAUDE.md section) that personalize Claude's responses.

Routes to the profile-user workflow which orchestrates the full flow: consent gate, session analysis or questionnaire fallback, profile generation, result display, and artifact selection.
</objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/profile-user.md
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Flags from $ARGUMENTS:
- `--questionnaire` -- Skip session analysis entirely, use questionnaire-only path
- `--refresh` -- Rebuild profile even when one exists, backup old profile, show dimension diff
</context>

<process>
Execute the profile-user workflow end-to-end.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Initialization and existing profile detection
2. Consent gate before session analysis
3. Session scanning and data sufficiency checks
4. Session analysis (profiler agent) or questionnaire fallback
5. Cross-project split resolution
6. Profile writing to USER-PROFILE.md
7. Result display with report card and highlights
8. Artifact selection (dev-preferences, CLAUDE.md sections)
9. Sequential artifact generation
10. Summary with refresh diff (if applicable)
</process>
