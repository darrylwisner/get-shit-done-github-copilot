<!-- upstream-tools: ["Read","Write","Bash","AskUserQuestion"] -->

## Path Resolution 

  The GSD workflow files contain bash commands that reference `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. 
  **In this workspace, the module lives at `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` relative to the workspace root — `$HOME` does not apply.
  ** When executing or interpreting any bash snippet from a workflow file, mentally substitute `$HOME/.claude/` → `.claude/` (workspace-relative).

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Manage GSD workspaces with a single consolidated command.

Mode routing:
- **--new**: Create an isolated workspace with repo copies and independent .planning/ → new-workspace workflow
- **--list**: List active GSD workspaces and their status → list-workspaces workflow
- **--remove**: Remove a GSD workspace and clean up worktrees → remove-workspace workflow
</objective>

<routing>

| Flag | Action | Workflow |
|------|--------|----------|
| --new | Create workspace with worktree/clone strategy | new-workspace |
| --list | Scan ~/gsd-workspaces/, show summary table | list-workspaces |
| --remove | Confirm and remove workspace directory | remove-workspace |

</routing>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/new-workspace.md
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/list-workspaces.md
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/remove-workspace.md
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the first token of $ARGUMENTS:
- If it is `--new`: strip the flag, pass remainder (--name, --repos, --path, --strategy, --branch, --auto flags) to new-workspace workflow
- If it is `--list`: execute list-workspaces workflow (no argument needed)
- If it is `--remove`: strip the flag, pass remainder (workspace-name) to remove-workspace workflow
- Otherwise (no flag): show usage — one of --new, --list, or --remove is required
</context>

<process>
1. Parse the leading flag from $ARGUMENTS.
2. Load and execute the appropriate workflow end-to-end based on the routing table above.
3. Preserve all workflow gates from the target workflow (validation, approvals, commits, routing).
</process>
