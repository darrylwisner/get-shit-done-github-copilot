## Path Resolution 

  The GSD workflow files contain bash commands that reference `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. 
  **In this workspace, the module lives at `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` relative to the workspace root — `$HOME` does not apply.
  ** When executing or interpreting any bash snippet from a workflow file, mentally substitute `$HOME/.claude/` → `.claude/` (workspace-relative).

Route to the appropriate exploration / capture skill based on the user's intent.
`gsd-note`, `gsd-add-todo`, `gsd-add-backlog`, and `gsd-plant-seed` were folded
into `gsd-capture` (with `--note`, default, `--backlog`, `--seed` modes) by
#2790. The capture target lists pending todos via `--list`.

| User wants | Invoke |
|---|---|
| Explore an idea or opportunity | gsd-explore |
| Sketch out a rough design or plan | gsd-sketch |
| Time-boxed technical spike | gsd-spike |
| Write a spec for a phase | gsd-spec-phase |
| Capture a thought (todo / note / backlog / seed) | gsd-capture |

Invoke the matched skill directly using the Skill tool.
