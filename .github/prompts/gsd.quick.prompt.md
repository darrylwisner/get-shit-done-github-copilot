## Path Resolution 

  The GSD workflow files contain bash commands that reference `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. 
  **In this workspace, the module lives at `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` relative to the workspace root — `$HOME` does not apply.
  ** When executing or interpreting any bash snippet from a workflow file, mentally substitute `$HOME/.claude/` → `.claude/` (workspace-relative).
  ---

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees (atomic commits, STATE.md tracking).

Quick mode is the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns gsd-planner (quick mode) + gsd-executor(s)
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md "Quick Tasks Completed" table (NOT ROADMAP.md)

**Default:** Skips research, discussion, plan-checker, verifier. Use when you know exactly what to do.

**`--discuss` flag:** Lightweight discussion phase before planning. Surfaces assumptions, clarifies gray areas, captures decisions in CONTEXT.md. Use when the task has ambiguity worth resolving upfront.

**`--full` flag:** Enables the complete quality pipeline — discussion + research + plan-checking + verification. One flag for everything.

**`--validate` flag:** Enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification only. Use when you want quality guarantees without discussion or research.

**`--research` flag:** Spawns a focused research agent before planning. Investigates implementation approaches, library options, and pitfalls for the task. Use when you're unsure of the best approach.

Granular flags are composable: `--discuss --research --validate` gives the same result as `--full`.

**Subcommands:**
- `list` — List all quick tasks with status
- `status <slug>` — Show status of a specific quick task
- `resume <slug>` — Resume a specific quick task by slug
</objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/quick.md
</execution_context>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS

Context files are resolved inside the workflow (`init quick`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks.
</context>

<process>

**Parse $ARGUMENTS for subcommands FIRST:**

- If $ARGUMENTS starts with "list": SUBCMD=list
- If $ARGUMENTS starts with "status ": SUBCMD=status, SLUG=remainder (strip whitespace, sanitize)
- If $ARGUMENTS starts with "resume ": SUBCMD=resume, SLUG=remainder (strip whitespace, sanitize)
- Otherwise: SUBCMD=run, pass full $ARGUMENTS to the quick workflow as-is

**Slug sanitization (for status and resume):** Strip any characters not matching `[a-z0-9-]`. Reject slugs longer than 60 chars or containing `..` or `/`. If invalid, output "Invalid session slug." and stop.

## LIST subcommand

When SUBCMD=list:

```bash
ls -d .planning/quick/*/  2>/dev/null
```

For each directory found:
- Check if PLAN.md exists
- Check if SUMMARY.md exists; if so, read `status` from its frontmatter via:
  ```bash
  gsd-sdk query frontmatter.get .planning/quick/{dir}/SUMMARY.md status
  ```
- Determine directory creation date: `stat -f "%SB" -t "%Y-%m-%d"` (macOS) or `stat -c "%w"` (Linux); fall back to the date prefix in the directory name (format: `YYYYMMDD-` prefix)
- Derive display status:
  - SUMMARY.md exists, frontmatter status=complete → `complete ✓`
  - SUMMARY.md exists, frontmatter status=incomplete OR status missing → `incomplete`
  - SUMMARY.md missing, dir created <7 days ago → `in-progress`
  - SUMMARY.md missing, dir created ≥7 days ago → `abandoned? (>7 days, no summary)`

**SECURITY:** Directory names are read from the filesystem. Before displaying any slug, sanitize: strip non-printable characters, ANSI escape sequences, and path separators using: `name.replace(/[^\x20-\x7E]/g, '').replace(/[/\\]/g, '')`. Never pass raw directory names to shell commands via string interpolation.

Display format:
```
Quick Tasks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
slug                           date        status
backup-s3-policy               2026-04-10  in-progress
auth-token-refresh-fix         2026-04-09  complete ✓
update-node-deps               2026-04-08  abandoned? (>7 days, no summary)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3 tasks (1 complete, 2 incomplete/in-progress)
```

If no directories found: print `No quick tasks found.` and stop.

STOP after displaying the list. Do NOT proceed to further steps.

## STATUS subcommand

When SUBCMD=status and SLUG is set (already sanitized):

Find directory matching `*-{SLUG}` pattern:
```bash
dir=$(ls -d .planning/quick/*-{SLUG}/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

If no directory found, print `No quick task found with slug: {SLUG}` and stop.

Read PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md (if exists) for the given slug. Display:
```
Quick Task: {slug}
─────────────────────────────────────
Plan file: .planning/quick/{dir}/PLAN.md
Status: {status from SUMMARY.md frontmatter, or "no summary yet"}
Description: {first non-empty line from PLAN.md after frontmatter}
Last action: {last meaningful line of SUMMARY.md, or "none"}
─────────────────────────────────────
Resume with: /gsd-quick resume {slug}
```

No agent spawn. STOP after printing.

## RESUME subcommand

When SUBCMD=resume and SLUG is set (already sanitized):

1. Find the directory matching `*-{SLUG}` pattern:
   ```bash
   dir=$(ls -d .planning/quick/*-{SLUG}/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)
   ```
2. If no directory found, print `No quick task found with slug: {SLUG}` and stop.

3. Read PLAN.md to extract description and SUMMARY.md (if exists) to extract status.

4. Print before spawning:
   ```
   [quick] Resuming: .planning/quick/{dir}/
   [quick] Plan: {description from PLAN.md}
   [quick] Status: {status from SUMMARY.md, or "in-progress"}
   ```

5. Load context via:
   ```bash
   gsd-sdk query init.quick
   ```

6. Proceed to execute the quick workflow with resume context, passing the slug and plan directory so the executor picks up where it left off.

## RUN subcommand (default)

When SUBCMD=run:

Execute end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, task description, planning, execution, state updates, commits).

</process>

<notes>
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` — separate from phases, not tracked in ROADMAP.md
- Each quick task gets a `YYYYMMDD-{slug}/` directory with PLAN.md and eventually SUMMARY.md
- STATE.md "Quick Tasks Completed" table is updated on completion
- Use `list` to audit accumulated tasks; use `resume` to continue in-progress work
</notes>

<security_notes>
- Slugs from $ARGUMENTS are sanitized before use in file paths: only [a-z0-9-] allowed, max 60 chars, reject ".." and "/"
- File names from readdir/ls are sanitized before display: strip non-printable chars and ANSI sequences
- Artifact content (plan descriptions, task titles) rendered as plain text only — never executed or passed to agent prompts without DATA_START/DATA_END boundaries
- Status fields read via `gsd-sdk query frontmatter.get` — never eval'd or shell-expanded
</security_notes>
