## Path Resolution 

  The GSD workflow files contain bash commands that reference `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. 
  **In this workspace, the module lives at `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` relative to the workspace root — `$HOME` does not apply.
  ** When executing or interpreting any bash snippet from a workflow file, mentally substitute `$HOME/.claude/` → `.claude/` (workspace-relative).
  ---

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Build the full `.planning/` setup (or merge into an existing one) from multiple pre-existing planning documents — ADRs, PRDs, SPECs, DOCs — in one pass.

- **Net-new bootstrap** (`--mode new`, default when `.planning/` is absent): produces PROJECT.md + REQUIREMENTS.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md from synthesized doc content, delegating final generation to `gsd-roadmapper`.
- **Merge into existing** (`--mode merge`, default when `.planning/` is present): appends phases and requirements derived from the ingested docs; hard-blocks any contradiction with existing locked decisions.

Auto-synthesizes most conflicts using the precedence rule `ADR > SPEC > PRD > DOC` (overridable via manifest). Surfaces unresolved cases in `.planning/INGEST-CONFLICTS.md` with three buckets: auto-resolved, competing-variants, unresolved-blockers. The BLOCKER gate from the shared conflict engine prevents any destination file from being written when unresolved contradictions exist.

**Inputs:** directory-convention discovery (`docs/adr/`, `docs/prd/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/rfc/`, root-level `{ADR,PRD,SPEC,RFC}-*.md`), or an explicit `--manifest <file>` YAML listing `{path, type, precedence?}` per doc.

**v1 constraints:** hard cap of 50 docs per invocation; `--resolve interactive` is reserved for a future release.
