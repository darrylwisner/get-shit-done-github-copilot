## Path Resolution 

  The GSD workflow files contain bash commands that reference `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. 
  **In this workspace, the module lives at `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` relative to the workspace root — `$HOME` does not apply.
  ** When executing or interpreting any bash snippet from a workflow file, mentally substitute `$HOME/.claude/` → `.claude/` (workspace-relative).

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Execute all remaining milestone phases autonomously. For each phase: discuss → plan → execute. Pauses only for user decisions (grey area acceptance, blockers, validation requests).

Uses ROADMAP.md phase discovery and Skill() flat invocations for each phase command. After all phases complete: milestone audit → complete → cleanup.

**Creates/Updates:**
- `.planning/STATE.md` — updated after each phase
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — progress updated after each phase
- Phase artifacts — CONTEXT.md, PLANs, SUMMARYs per phase

**After:** Milestone is complete and cleaned up.

</execution_context>

<context>
Optional flags:
- `--from N` — start from phase N instead of the first incomplete phase.
- `--to N` — stop after phase N completes (halt instead of advancing to next phase).
- `--only N` — execute only phase N (single-phase mode).
- `--interactive` — run discuss inline with questions (not auto-answered), then dispatch plan→execute as background agents. Keeps the main context lean while preserving user input on decisions.

Project context, phase list, and state are resolved inside the workflow using init commands (`gsd-sdk query init.milestone-op`, `gsd-sdk query roadmap.analyze`). No upfront context loading needed.
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (phase discovery, per-phase execution, blocker handling, progress display).
