## Path Resolution 

  The GSD workflow files contain bash commands that reference `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. 
  **In this workspace, the module lives at `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` relative to the workspace root — `$HOME` does not apply.
  ** When executing or interpreting any bash snippet from a workflow file, mentally substitute `$HOME/.claude/` → `.claude/` (workspace-relative).

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Import external plan files into the GSD planning system with conflict detection against PROJECT.md decisions.

- **--from**: Import an external plan file, detect conflicts, write as GSD PLAN.md, validate via gsd-plan-checker.

Future: `--prd` mode for PRD extraction is planned for a follow-up PR.
